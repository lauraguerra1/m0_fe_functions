# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - During the learning portion of this assignment, I was very intrigued by the age calculator. Although the directions said not to worry about months and days, I had to satiate my curriosity. I had some extra time on my hands and wanted to build a function that would return the user's **actual age**, *not the age they will be after their birthday has passed* this year. I started out with a function and some if and elseif statements using the current day, month, and year stored in variables. However, that would need to be updated on a daily basis, so I did some research and learned how to use the `Date()` constructor along with the keyword `new`, and various methods to pull numbers out of the current date. 
    - I am proud of this because I was able to use my curiousity as fuel to learn a few extra things on my own, and practice using Google. I think that building the capacity to *learn how to solve problems* with code, especially by *researching on my own*,  will be a critical skill as a developer. So all in all, I am proud that I am getting used to doing that now. 
    - I took the liberty of creating an extra file, titled `justForFun.js`, which houses the said Age Calculator function. If the reader reviewing this assginement has the extra time, please feel free to have a look and provide me with any constructive criticism ðŸ˜Œ. 
        - ...(P.S.I hope it's okay that I did that!)

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    - Functions allow us to provide our applications with sets of instructions. They are small chunks of instructions that are not affected by the rest of the code, and thus make the program more manageable.
